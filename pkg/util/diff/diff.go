// 1) The 'desiredObject' is constructed via code.  It will almost certainly have many, many (nested) empty values.
// 2) It is compared against a 'liveObject', which has been retrieved live from the Kubernetes API, and has many of
//    these empty values populated with (k8s-generated) default values.
// In this situation, to determine whether our desiredObject is truly different than the liveObject, we ignore processing
